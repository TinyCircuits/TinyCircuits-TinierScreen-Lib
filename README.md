# TinyCircuits Tinier Screen Arduino Library

This Arduino library is intended for use with TinyCircuits' **[0.42" OLED Wireling](https://tinycircuits.com/collections/wireling-displays-leds/products/0-42-oled-screen-wireling)**, **[0.69" OLED Wireling](https://tinycircuits.com/collections/wireling-displays-leds/products/0-69-oled-screen-wireling)**, and **[0.96" OLED Wireling](https://tinycircuits.com/collections/wireling-displays-leds/products/0-96-oled-screen-wireling)**. 

*Support this library by buying products from **[TinyCircuits](https://tinycircuits.com/)***


## Tinier Screen Class Basics

The Tinier Screen Library relies upon the **[Graphics Buffer Library](https://github.com/TinyCircuits/TinyCircuits-GraphicsBuffer-Lib)** to create a graphics buffer, and this library will then use that buffer to print it to the screen used.
